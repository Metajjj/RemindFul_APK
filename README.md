# RemindFul_APK
The public APK of my private repository

The loading screen (first activity) - Swipe up + down (gestures) to change the theme/colours through a cycle.
The main page (second activity) - Drag right to open a detailed view of notes.. else the ScrollView containing notes is generally suitable
The application relies on notifications as an interaction between user and app for the reminding capabilities and is recommended to put notifications to silent for this app.
Default theme for this app is a dark yellow (#FFAB9866) background and brown (#6C5346) text with bright yellow titles (#f4d882)
